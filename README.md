# Bevy Lightyear Template

Multi-transport networked game template using Bevy and Lightyear.

**Game Vision**: See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the game design document.

## Features

- **Server**: Authoritative server supporting UDP, WebTransport, and WebSocket
- **Native Client**: Desktop client connecting via UDP
- **WASM Client**: Browser client connecting via WebTransport/WebSocket
- **Voxel Map System**: Networked voxel terrain (voxel_map_engine, in progress)
- **Ability System**: Data-driven abilities loaded from RON assets with networked replication

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

This installs dependencies and generates certificates.

### 2. Run Server

```bash
cargo server
```

Server listens on:
- UDP: `0.0.0.0:5000`
- WebTransport: `0.0.0.0:5001`
- WebSocket: `0.0.0.0:5002`

### 3. Run Native Client

```bash
cargo client
```

Connects to server via UDP on `127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 4. Run WASM Client

```bash
bevy run --bin web
```

Opens browser to HTTPS dev server. Client connects via WebTransport on `127.0.0.1:5001`.

**Note**: Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser.

## Development

### Cargo Aliases

- `cargo server` - Run server
- `cargo client` - Run native client
- `cargo check-all` - Check all crates
- `cargo build-all` - Build all native targets
- `cargo web-build` - Build WASM client

### Certificate Regeneration

Certificates expire after 14 days. Regenerate with:

```bash
sh certificates/generate.sh
```

### WASM Development

Bevy CLI provides hot reload for WASM development:

```bash
# From project root:
bevy run --bin web

# Or with auto-open in browser:
bevy run --bin web --open
```

## Ability System

Abilities are defined in `assets/abilities.ron` and loaded at startup. Each character has 4 ability slots mapped to keys 1-4.

### Hotkeys

- `1` - Ability slot 1
- `2` - Ability slot 2
- `3` - Ability slot 3
- `4` - Ability slot 4

### Defining Abilities

Edit `assets/abilities.ron` to add or modify abilities. Each ability has:
- Phase durations (startup, active, recovery) in ticks (64 ticks = 1 second)
- Cooldown in ticks
- Effects list with triggers: `OnTick` (fires once on a specified Active-phase tick offset, defaults to tick 0), `WhileActive` (fires every tick), `OnHit` (fires when a hitbox/projectile hits a target), `OnEnd` (fires on Active exit), or `OnInput` (fires on input during Active for combo chaining)
- Effect types: `Melee`, `Projectile`, `AreaOfEffect`, `SetVelocity`, `Damage`, `ApplyForce`, `Ability` (spawns sub-ability), `Teleport`, `Shield`, or `Buff`
