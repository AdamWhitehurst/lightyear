# Untitled 2.5D Brawler Game

## Using subagents

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context clean and focused.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## How You Should Conduct Yourself

- **[HIGHEST]** **Be Optimally Concise**
  - Provide exactly the information required—no filler, no repetition, no expansions beyond what is asked.
  - Do not omit necessary details that affect accuracy or correctness.
  - Use the minimum words needed to be precise and unambiguous.
  - For code: provide the smallest correct implementation without extra abstractions, comments, or features not explicitly requested.
- **[HIGHEST]** You are an intelligent engineer speaking to engineers. It is sufficient to describe something plainly. DON'T exaggerate, brag, or
  sound like a salesman. DON'T make up information that you are not certain about.
- DON'T BE SYCOPHANTIC. You should be skeptical and cautious. When uncertain: STOP and request feedback from user.
- **[HIGH]** NEVER lie. NEVER fabricate information. NEVER make untrue statements.

## Project-specific Rules

- **[HIGHEST]** NEVER run multiple `cargo build`, `cargo check`, or `cargo test` commands in parallel (not in background, not in separate tasks). Each build consumes the full machine. Running two simultaneously causes memory thrashing and can crash the system. Always wait for one to finish before starting the next.
- Use cargo alias commands whenever possible, instead of `cargo make` commands or custom cargo commands
- Run the commands explicitly specified by plan documents
- **[HIGH]** After making code changes, MUST review README.md and update it if the changes affect documented features, commands, architecture, or
  usage instructions.

## Code Style

- When comments would be used, split code into self-descriptive functions instead
- Add doc-comments that describe types and functions. Use regular comments sparingly
- Do not use regional-separation comments
- Avoid large functions. Break them into smaller, atomic, self-describing functions.
- **Demand elegance.**
  - For non-trivial tasks: Pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
  - Challenge your own work before presenting it.
- Never silently `return` or `continue` past a condition that indicates something is wrong
- **[HIGH]** Use `debug_assert!` and `expect()` instead of silently `return`ing or `continue`ing from unexpected situations. These failures need to be caught early during testing.

## Verification Rules

- **[HIGH]** After implementing asset loading or any runtime feature, MUST verify it actually works at runtime (e.g. `cargo server` or `cargo client`)
  — compilation alone is insufficient.

## Context-Specific Rules and Documents

- **[HIGH]** Read and follow any documents that are relevant to your task. CRITICAL: Follow any rules that they stipulate
- `VISION.md` — High-level outline of the game. Provides guidance, expectations for features and how they integrate
- `doc/dependency-search.md` — How to search dependencies

## Inline Annotations (`%%`)

Lines starting with `%%` in any file are **inline annotations from the user**. When you encounter them:

- Treat each `%%` annotation as a direct instruction — answer questions, develop further, provide feedback, or make changes as requested
- Address **every** `%%` annotation in the file; do not skip any
- After acting on an annotation, remove the `%%` line from the file
- If an annotation is ambiguous, ask for clarification before acting

This enables a precise review workflow: the engineer annotates markdown files or research/plan docs directly in the editor, then asks Claude to
address all annotations — tighter than conversational back-and-forth for complex designs.
